How to copy by value a composite datatype (array+objects)?
Arrays,objects,functions are all of object type which comes under composite data type.
The variables hold data but in case of composite datatype it holds the reference that is the address of the particular value in memory.
for example:
var a=10; //here a hold the value 10.
var b=[10,100];  //here b hold the address
therefore to copy the data of composite data type we have two methods.
1)spread operator(...).
2)iteration.
Spred operator spreads the elements of that particular array or object and it values are to used to assign to someother variables.
var a=[1,2,3];
var b=[...a];
var b[0]=10;
console.log(a);  //[1,2,3];
console.log(b);  //[10,2,3];
By using iteration we can copy the values to some other variables.
var a=[1,2,3];
var b=[];
for(var i in a){
b[i]=a[i];
}
b[0]=10;
console.log(a); //[1,2,3]
console.log(b);  //[10,2,3].
