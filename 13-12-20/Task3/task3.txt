Copy by value:
var a=10;
var b='kk';
var x=a;
var y=b;
console.log(a,b,x,y);// 10,'kk',10,'kk' .
here the values are directly copied from one variable to other.
At this point of time both ‘x’ and ‘a’ contains the value 10. Both ‘y’ and ‘b’ contains the value ‘kk’. 
However, an important thing to understand here is that even though ‘x’ and ‘a’ as well as ‘y’ and ‘b’ contains the same value they are not connected to each other. 
It is so because the values are directly copied into the new variables.
Copy by reference:
var a=[1,2,3];
var b=a;
b[0]=10;
console.log(a); //[10,2,3];
At this point the value of a is [1,2,3] but var b is assigned to a as it is a composite data type the b is not assigned to the value of a but it is pointing towards the address of a.
so if b got changed it will update the values of a.
